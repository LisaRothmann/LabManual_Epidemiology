# Lab Resources

The RIPLRT employs a series of digital resources, which helps many of which helps us protect the environment by being *paperless*, promoting the mission of the RIPLRT, and facilitate our productivity, reproducibility, and to contribute to the [Open-Science movement](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/portals-and-platforms/goap/open-science-movement/). 

## ELabJournal
The RIPLRT employs [ELabJournal](https://www.elabjournal.com/) as the platform to document and link projects, studies, and experiments -- basically as a lab notebook. Also, ELabJournal is the platform the RIPLRT employs to perform sample inventory, such as identifying where each sample (and its replicate, if applicable) is located within the laboratory. For non-interns only, ELabJournal will be the platforms for documenting experiments -- hard copy lab notebooks will be available to make notes during experiments, but the final documentation will be in ELabJournal. Non-intern lab members must go through a in-lab training, by the PI or Lab Manager, on how to properly use ELabJournal. Also, sample information will be managed only through ELabJournal.

*Note*: ELabJournal will be used only by RIPLRT members that *are not* in the category of interns or students unless otherwise stated by Dr. Rivera-Mariani. For interns and students, refer to RSpace

## FigShare and Zenodo:
FigShare^TM^ (https://figshare.com/) and Zenodo^TM^ (https://zenodo.org/) are two of the platforms we employ to contribute to the Open Science movement and the efforts to make reproducible science available to the public, including the scientific community. Make sure to create an account and ask Dr. Rivera-Mariani to invite you into the RIPLRT workspaces within these platforms. Before submitting anything to FigShare or Zenodo and making it public, make sure to consult with Dr. Rivera-Mariani or the Research Assistants. 

## GitHub:
GitHub is a way to share codes (also data) to people outside of our lab. Coding is used throughout our research projects, everyday analysis and website. Our github repository is https://www..github.com/riplrt. Github is one of our venues to contribute to the Open-Science movement (refer to our Wiki page: https://wiki.riplrt.com). Also, make sure to familiarize with Github and to ask Dr. Rivera-Mariani or the Lab Manager to provide you with a brief training of how to use Github. Before submitting anything to Github and making it public, make sure to consult with Dr. Rivera-Mariani and the Lab Manager. 

## Google account:
**Gmail**: We have a riplrt email domain: username@riplrt.com. All emails related to RIPLRT should be communicated through this email domain. Make sure to ask Dr. Rivera-Mariani to add you to our domain. **Google drive**: there is a riplrt drive (https://drive.riplrt.com) that will contain all documents shared intra-lab only, including collaborations. **Google calendar**: invites to events and meetings are sent through Google calendar.   

## GoToMeeting: 
This platform is used for video conferences. if a member is not available onsite, we are able to set up an meeting through GoToMeeting. Make sure to familiarize with this app.

## Open Science Framework
Together with Github, FigShare, and Zenogo, we contribute to the Open-Science movement through the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform (https://osf.io/). When data or codes that we have developed and employed in our projects are finally curated (i.e. not needed any other editing), they will be uploaded to the OSF. As with GitHub, FigShare, and Zenodo, consult with Dr. Rivera-Mariani or the Lab Manager before submitting anything to OSF and making it public.

## PubCrawler: 
Keeping up with science, including in topics related to the RIPLRT scientific mission, sometimes is challenging. We use PubCrawler (http://pubcrawler.gen.tcd.ie/) to help narrow the difficulties of being up-to-date with scientific findings. Make sure to create an account with PubCrawler and review the weekly hits PubCrawler will send you as they relate to topic of the RIPLRT’s research mission.  Make sure to familiarize with this  plateform.

## Quartzy
One of the aspects that aids in carrying out efficient and reproducible science is to have full control of our inventory. For this reason, we integrate into the RIPLRT inventory the lab management platform Quartzy (https://www.quartzy.com). This platform helps organize and track locations and quantities of consumable, reagents, solutions, among other items. Quartzy also allows to order items directly from its platform. Dr. Rivera-Mariani has used this platform while he was a post-doctoral fellow at the Bloomberg School of Public Health of the Johns Hopkins University. 

## R and R Studio
Our lab also employs reproducible approaches for analyzing data. For this purpose, our data analysis protocols use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as the platforms. Here we employ scripts that we often share through Github, RSpace, Open Science Framework, FigShare, and Zenodo. Learning to use R and Rstudio will be one of the skillsets you will develop with the RIPLRT.

## Rspace
Our lab's mentees (i.e. interns and students) use Rspace (https://community.researchspace.com/login) as an electronic lab records. Each mentee will have acess to a hard copy lab notebook to make notes during experiments; nevertheless, final documentation will be in RSpace.

## Slack
Our principal venue of communication (daily and in weekends) is through Slack^TM^. Our work space is riplrt.slack.com. We have seperate channels with different themes about ongoing topics in the lab. We are able to share information, documents, and pictures through Slack^TM^. Make sure to ask Dr. Rivera-Mariani to add you into our Slack workspace, and to familiarize with this app. 

*Note*: we won't be able to make exceptions if, for example, a member of RIPLRT prefers other venues of communication. Slack will be our main venue of communication, unless otherwise stated in some exceptional cases.

## Website
The RIPLRT has a motherboard known as our website (www.riplrt.com). Here you will find oodles of past, current, and future information regarding the group. You can also follow RIPLRT’s updates and blogs here. Similar to this lab  manual, it is also a work-in-progress. Each lab member must provide a profile photo, a short bio to be included in the lab members section, as well a video interview, where you will be introduced to our site visitors.
 (https://www.riplrt.com/members/).

## WhenIWork
In order to keep track of the hours worked in the lab, we implement the [WhenIWork](https://login.wheniwork.com/) platform for signing in and out. WhenIWork (or WIWI as we often refer to it) allows Dr. Rivera-Mariani Rivera to create a schedule on the master account with tasks, shifts, and time slots for RIPLRT members. Another important feature is the desktop sign in sheet that lab members can access on RIPLRT’s computer. Now lets say that the computer is unaccessible, you have to option of signing in on your smartphone that will track your sign in and out location via GPS.
To get started, be sure to let Dr. Rivera-Mariani know and he will send an invite where you will be directed to create an account and start tracking your time in lab. The smartphone app has many features and should can be very useful. If you have any trouble accessing or correctly logging your time sheet please contact Dr. Rivera-Mariani.

*Note*: it is expected that each member of the RIPLRT, including interns, post their availability at a minimum of two-weeks in advance. Tasks won't be able to be assigned until the whole week lists your availability/unavailability day/timeslots.

## Wiki
The RIPLRT lab has a wiki page (http://wiki.riplrt.com/), where we share the library of resources and information we employ in our daily endeavors in the RIPLRT. You will be amazed all the resources we integrate in our scientific-mentoring mission. Similar to this lab manual, our Wiki page is also a work-in-progress.
