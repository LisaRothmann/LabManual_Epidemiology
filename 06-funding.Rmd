# Funding

Funding for the lab currently comes from RIPLRT funding campaing as well as Dr. Rivera-Marianiâ€™s grants. If you need to buy something, or have to charge a grant for something, let Dr. Rivera-Mariani know and he will oversee the process.
 
At some point, you will likely be asked to provide a figure or two for a grant(s) Dr. Rivera is writing, and/or provide feedback on the grant. Relatedly, you are entitled to read any grant Dr. Rivera has submitted, whether it is ultimately funded or not: all grant documentations, similarly to everything else in RIPLRT, is available intra-lab within our team drive in Google. Aside from being a good opportunity to learn how grants are written, this will also allow you to see his vision for the lab in the years ahead. Feel free to ask Dr. Rivera to see any of his grants: remember that everything is available in our team drive. .
