# General Policies

## Communication
*Weekly meetings*: every Monday, the group have a video conference at 6PM (EST) via GoToMeeting. Topics and tasks are usually discussed prior and further elaboration takes place during this weekly call. 
Slack^TM^: stay in tune with Slack. Research talk moves fast and does not take days off. Stay connected through slack and you should be fine.

*Documents*: Unless stated otherwise, all documents we create or upload are made availabble to all RIPLRT members through our RIPLRT Drive in the G-suite. Please be sure to share everything to the RIPLRT Drive and asssign the document the corresponding name, in the correct format, even if it is the very first draft of a document and you are the sole author of the document. *This is one of our foundational policies -- to have an open group in order to be able to contribute to the Open Science movement*. 

## Hours
Currently, we do not have a set schedule. Nevertheless, we employ the Homebase app to inform the Lab Manager and the PI our weekly availability to facilitate being assinged tasks and projects. *Don't forget to update your availability every week through the Homebase app (refer to section 3.5 of this lab manual)*.

If you plant to be in the lab outside the assigned schedule as per the Homebase app, please let Dr. Rivera-Mariani know.

## Deadlines 
Every deadline is a hard deadline (unless otherwise stated by Dr. Rivera-Mariani or within the RIPLRT). With that being said, be sure to stay up to date and punctual with meetings and submissions. Remember, you want your time to be appreciated: RIPLRT lab members also deserve their time to be appreciated as well.

## Presentations
Communication skills, including in written and verbal forms, are key to move science forward. The RIPLRT carry outs a series of Journal Club, and it is expected that lab members participate in this Journal Clubs. If you have been assigned a Journal Club date, make sure to first consult with Dr. Rivera-Mariniani the article(s) that you plan to discuss. Also, practice, practice, practice as these Journal Clubs are often broadcasted live to the web.

## Conferences/ Travel
Our group advocates travel for conferences to present current and ongoing research projects, to network with colleagues from other institutions and countries, and as another way to be updated with science. Different conferences offer grants for travel and each person interested in attending the conference is responsible for funding their costs. Some funds may be available upon request. It is highly recommended to each RIPLRT member to be on the look for scholarhsip, travel awards, or other funding opportunities to attend to conferences.
